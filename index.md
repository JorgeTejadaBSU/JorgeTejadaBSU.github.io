## Welcome to my projects!

You can visit my main github page using this [link](https://github.com/JorgeTejadaBSU)!
**The project to edit this website will be private after "Module 4 - Create your own Github Page!" has been graded for CS-HU250!!!**          
**Projects for different classes will be uploaded with permission from professors during the semester if they have been graded, once the class has ended at the end of the semester or after graduation projects will uploaded to be used as references**
